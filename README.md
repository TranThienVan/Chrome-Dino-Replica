Hello, this is the Running Dino CLONE game which takes the inspiration from a famous Running Dino Chrome Game when user lost their connection to the Internet. 

The game still have 2 bugs that needs to work on: 

1/ Due to the requestAnimationFrame requires to game to update constantly, if the user has a high refresh rate monitor (240hz or 144hz), the game will run very fast 

2/ The javascript line 165: player.originalHeight will be sometime cannot recognize by the Chrome. User have to refresh the page in ordeer to play the game
